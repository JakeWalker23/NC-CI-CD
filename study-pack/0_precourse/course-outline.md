# Course Outline

## Overview

We begin the week looking at **containers**, a popular way of creating runtime environments for applications, locally on your machine. We'll put this to the side for the second day when we start to learn about some **cloud services** using the AWS console, and then bring it back containers on the third day to see how they can be used in production. On the fourth day we'll look at how **continuous integration and deployment** can be used to give us confidence to get our _applications_ on the cloud, then on the final day, delve into **infrastructure as code** and its benefits in getting the _infrastructure_ we've created on the cloud.

Sessions begin at 9.15 with some discussion of the prompt questions and revisiting concepts from the day before (see more below). Workshops will take place through to the early afternoon - we'll break for lunch when it feels good. _We will ask you what you had for lunch_. More on the rest of the day below.

## How to do this course

Included in this pack are some materials for before and after each session.

_Before_ each session, please take a look at some of the prompt questions that we can use to inform our discussions at the start of the day - these discussions should help you visualise what we're learning in more practical settings. There are also some basic, short introductory videos / articles we've sourced for you to watch which should again give you a bit of grounding in the purposes for the purposes and real-world applications of the technologies we'll be exploring.

_After_ the taught part of each session (which will last on average half the day but may go a bit either way) there are some resources to help you self-assess your understanding. _It's important you don't feel like you should be able to go away and recreate what make in the session with no further input_. Tackling these questions and mini-tasks should help you figure out where the gaps are in your understanding so you can use these tools in much more interesting ways in the future!

Beside these resources, there are larger tasks you can do to check your understanding against. These probably won't be completed in the day of the workshop, but you can take these away to help cement your practices over the coming weeks. There are also notes for each section which should outline all the steps, and you may want to use these to prompt something you weren't quite sure about during the course, but we would suggest that following these steps alone won't do much to increase your understanding.

Most of the workshop time, we'd like you to watch, take in and question whilst we code, then you'll have chances to recreate and experiment through the day. Losing track of where we're at is no big deal - having a working version of the lecture example at the end of the day is _not an expected learning outcome_.
