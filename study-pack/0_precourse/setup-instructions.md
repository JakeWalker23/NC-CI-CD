# Setup Instructions

Through the course we will be using some command line tools and applications that we will be demonstrating on mac. There should be no issues running these on Linux. We have had students use Windows machines without problems but please bear in mind that we may be unable to support you with any OS-related difficulties - you will need to find Windows alternatives for some commands referenced in the notes.

You will also need to install or create accounts for some services:

## Zoom
- [Zoom installed](https://zoom.us/support/download)

## Docker
- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- An account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup)

## AWS
- A account on [AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
You will need to provide a debit/credit card number to set this up. Don't worry - we shouldn't be creating anything that is not included in the free tier. For this reason it's probably best to set up a new account (as the free tier only lasts for 12 months). Please make sure you follow our instructions to remove services to make sure you don't exceed the free tier limits.
- The [AWS CLI tool installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) (read the link or `brew install awscli`)

## CI/CD
- An account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join)

## Infrastructure as Code
- The [Terraform CLI installed](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
